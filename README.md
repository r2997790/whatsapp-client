The application now supports sending messages to WhatsApp groups! Here are the methods:

#### Method 1: Using Group Phone Number Format
Some groups have a phone number format that can be used directly:

- Format: `[countrycode][groupnumber]` (without + symbol)

#### Method 2: Using Group ID from WhatsApp Web
1. Open WhatsApp Web in your browser
2. Click on the group you want to message
3. Look at the URL - it will contain the group ID
4. Group ID format: `[numbers]@g.us`
5. Use the Group ID in the phone number field

**Example:** If URL shows `120363123456789@g.us`, use that in the phone number field

#### Important Notes for Group Messaging:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You must be an admin or have permission to send messages to the group
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some groups may have restrictions on who can send messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Group messaging follows the same rate limits as individual messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test with a single message first before sending bulk messages to groups

#### Tips for Group Messaging:
- Always verify the group ID is correct with a test message
- Consider the time zones of group members
- Keep messages relevant and respectful to the group's purpose
- Use bulk messaging sparingly to avoid being flagged as spam

### 5. View Results
